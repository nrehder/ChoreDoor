Project - Chore Door

First attempt at using javaScript within an HTML document.

It creates 3 doors, and randomly stores the location of 3 images.  The user can click on a door to reveal the image.  If they reveal anything but the ChoreBot, they may continue playing.  Revealing the ChoreBot stops the game.  You may click on the redish box to reset the game.  It counts how many times in a row you can get all 3 revealed.
